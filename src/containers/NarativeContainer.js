        <Paragraph>
                    The gap between demand and supply for software developers in Europe is estimated to be around 500.000 by 2020.
          <br />
          <br />
                    Spark developers narrows this gap by tapping into the exploding tech scene Sub-Saharan Africa, of which more than 60% of the population is under the age of 25.

        <Paragraph>
                    Although this is highly beneficial to Europeâ€™s growing ecosystem, our narrative and sphere of influence is fundamentally Africa-centric.
          <br />
          <br />
                    Through our incubation and mentorship programs, and in conjunction with our clients, Spark focuses largely on developing the African tech ecosystem in a sustainable and scalable way.
